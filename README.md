# Generating-a-virtual-bio-web-page
A virtual bio web page connects you to outside people and can exhibit your abilities to
many. Therefore it is good for everyone to maintain their own virtual portfolio and about me
page if they want to enter the IT world. So our project assists the people with a non-
technical background or the freshers or the businessmen or the experienced candidate to
create their own virtual portfolio and about me page.
The virtual bio page created can be accessed only within a smaller area. In the future,
we work to make it accessible over larger areas. In our project the saved registered
data in the database has not been used much so in the future we want to add new
features to the project so that it can make better use of the registered data for example
one of the features like whenever user logins into the website then his/her respective
details will be displayed in the details module and he can update the data with his new
achievements, interests, qualifications, etc.
